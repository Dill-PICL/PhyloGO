# PhyloGO
This gem provides Ruby methods and a command line tool for (Gene) Ontology-Based Phylogenetics Methods for Whole-Genome Comparison which we are currently developing as part of an upcoming publication (https://github.com/Dill-PICL/GOMAP-Paper-2019.1).
For a short but more clear explanation of the basic concepts see https://github.com/Thyra/EEOB563/blob/master/final_project/paper/Paper.pdf
